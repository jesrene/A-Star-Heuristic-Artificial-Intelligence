# Rubbish Bin Optimization Using A* Heuristic (Multiple goals)

This project aims to find an optimal path (least cost) for Ronny to clear out all the rubbish from various rooms using a rubbish bin. Ronny is equipped with a rubbish bin that can hold a total of 5 m3 of objects, and he can only move the rubbish bin of 40 kg.

## Project Details

This project includes the following key features:

- Results display and visualization of the rubbish disposal path.
- Creation of a maze grid map to represent the rooms and rubbish locations.
- Hex grid visualizer to visualize the hexagonal grid map.
- Animation of the path finding algorithm on the graph.
- Output display, including the hex grid map, solution overview, and sample iterations.
- Discussions on different input configurations for the hex grid, including JSON input format.
- Implementation of additional methods and systems for visualization purposes, such as the offset system.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Rubbish Disposal Path Finder, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file (`AI_Assignment.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.
3. Run the notebook cell by cell to execute the code and visualize the results.
4. Modify the input configurations or experiment with different settings to explore various scenarios.
5. Refer to the provided documentation within the notebook for detailed explanations and usage instructions.

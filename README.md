# Rubbish Bin Optimization Using A* Heuristic 

The objective of this project is to determine the most efficient route (minimizing costs) for Ronny to clean up waste from multiple rooms using a garbage bin. Ronny possesses a garbage bin capable of holding a maximum of 5 m3 of items, and he is constrained to move the bin, which weighs 40 kg.


## Project Details

This project includes the following key features:

1. Presentation and depiction of the pathway for waste disposal.
2. Development of a gridded maze map that illustrates the rooms and waste placements.
3. Employment of a hexagonal grid visualizer to represent the hex grid map.
4. Animation illustrating the operation of the pathfinding algorithm on the graph.
5. Output exhibition, which includes the hex grid map, an overview of the solution, and sample step-by-step progress.
6. Discussions pertaining to varied input setups for the hex grid, encompassing the employment of JSON format for input.
7. Incorporation of supplementary methods and systems aimed at visualization purposes, such as the offset mechanism.

## Getting Started

To initiate your involvement with the Rubbish Disposal Path Finder, adhere to the subsequent instructions:

1. Duplicate the repository onto your local device.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file ('AI_Assignment.ipynb') utilizing Jupyter Notebook or any compatible platform.
3. Progressively execute the notebook's content to execute the code and visualize the outcomes.
4. Modify the input settings as needed or explore diverse configurations to investigate different scenarios.
5. Consult the provided in-notebook documentation for comprehensive elucidations and instructions concerning utilization.
